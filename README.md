## General info
This was something simple but fun I guess that I thought of to try out Vue.js since it is new to me. There is an input field where you enter a color and when you enter a certain color the screen changes to the color you entered. If you find that no colors you entered are working there is an 'Example Colors' button below that opens up to reveal the colors that will work to change the background colors.

Also wanted to use Sass as it had been a while since I had used it to style my site.

Hope you enjoy!

* Work on understanding what more Vue.js has to offer and how it can be more useful in completing projects in future. See if there is more of an advantage to using Vue than React.
